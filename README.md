# BC Children's Work
Work I did as a Graduate Research Assistant for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation Analytics Team. The jupyter notebooks are organized as follows:

**1. Cleaning and Geocoding**
  - Cleaning & Aggregating data from different databases at the postal code level 
  - Adding a Lat/Long to each postal code through Google API 
  - Placing each BC postal code within a neighbourhood using shapefiles 
  
**2. EDA and Prediction** 
   - Exploring the dataset relationships (correlation matrix, plotting) 
   - Running prediction analysis on 2016 hospital donations: 
      * Multivariate Regression 
      * Multivariate Regression with PCA regressors 
      * Random Forest 
      
**3. Visualizations**
  - Heatmap and Chloropleth for donation + demographic data accross BC
